                Of course, to make games in Godot, you actually need to download Godot. Godot can be used to develop 2D and 3D games! As I write this the latest version of the engine is 4.3. 
                I love using this engine since I find its design intuitive and its uses versitile. If you want to learn how to use the engine, see the "Help" section of this website.

                Programming is logic based. So, it can be helpful to map out that logic. In fact, you may want to do the same when designing levels. For these purposes, Lucidchart is a great piece of software
                that you can use to plan out how your levels will flow and how your code will function. In this program you can make various shapes that can be connected with various types of arrows. It is very helpful
                for planning programming and game design.

        <h4>Microsoft Todo</h4>
        <div class="tool">
            <figure>
                <img class="image" src = "/Graphics/Design/todo.png" style="border-radius: 0%;">
                <figcaption>An example of a todo list you can make using the software.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Often, when working on projects, you want to create plans. This may be in terms of programming systems, designing the game, etc. Either way, I have a habit of making
                lists of things that need to be done. Microsoft Todo is a built in windows application that you can use to keep track of what you need to do. This app can be great for helping
                you stay organized and on track with set objectives.

        <h4>Microsoft Whiteboard</h4>
        <div class="tool">
            <figure>
                <img class="image" src = "/Graphics/Design/whiteboard.png" style="border-radius: 0%;">
                <figcaption>An example whiteboard</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Everyone (some people) likes making elaborate charts when planning things out. If you want to have an entire board with your game's vision, then Microsoft whiteboard
                can be a good alternative if you don't own an actual whiteboard. Using this app, you can brainstorm, plan out code, plan out levels, and more.
